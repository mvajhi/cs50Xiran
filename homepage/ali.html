    <h1>Nahj al-balagha</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p class="p1">Nahj al-balāgha (Arabic: نهج البلاغة) (the Peak of Eloquence) is a collection of sayings and writings of Imam 'Ali (a) which have been compiled by al-Sayyid al-Radi in late 4th/10th century (finished in 400/1009-10). The criterion for selecting the sayings has been the eloquence of speech. The eloquence in this compilation is at such a high level that even though al-Sayyid al-Radi was a great poet and distinguished man of literature and had great works, regarded this compilation an honor for himself.</p>

    <p class="p1">Nahj al-balagha has been organized into three parts: sermons, letters and short sayings. Throughout the sermons, Imam (a) calls people to obey God's orders and abandon prohibitions and in his letters advises his agents to observe the rights of people. Kalimat al-qisar (short sayings) of Nahj al-balagha are a collection of wise sayings stated at the Peak of Eloquence.</p>
